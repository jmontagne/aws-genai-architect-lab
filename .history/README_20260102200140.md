# 🧪 AWS GenAI Architect Lab

> **"One Concept, One POC. Infrastructure as Code by Default."**
> A collection of rapid prototypes, architectural experiments, and exam preparation labs for the **AWS Certified Generative AI Developer - Professional** (AIP-C01).

**Owner:** [Jacques Montagne](https://github.com/jmontagne)
**Status:** `Active Learning` | **Strategy:** `Safe Modernization`

## 🎯 The Philosophy
This repository is NOT a monolithic application. It is a **Laboratory** designed for deep, isolated understanding of AWS GenAI mechanics.

* **Speed over Polish:** Code is designed to verify a hypothesis, not to be production-perfect.
* **Isolation:** Each `POC-xx` folder is a standalone project with its own infrastructure.
* **Exam Focus:** Every POC maps directly to a specific domain in the AWS Certified Generative AI Developer Professional Exam.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** No manual console clicks. Everything is provisioned via **Terraform**.

## 🔬 The Experiments (Syllabus)

| ID | Domain | Experiment Name & Goal | Primary Stack | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **POC-01** | *Fundamentals* | **Bedrock Basics**: Raw SDK connectivity & Inference Parameters (Temp, Top-P). | Java SDK v2 | 🔄 Active |
| **POC-02** | *Architecture* | **The RAG Pipeline**: Advanced chunking & Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. | LangChain4j | ⏳ Planned |
| **POC-03** | *Agents* | **Agentic Tools**: Autonomous agents querying SQL databases safely. | Java / Tools | ⏳ Planned |
| **POC-04** | *Security* | **Security Guardrails**: PII filtering & GDPR compliance patterns. | Python / Boto3 | ⏳ Planned |
| **POC-05** | *Evaluation* | **Automated Eval**: Ragas-based scoring and "LLM-as-a-Judge" metrics. | Python / Ragas | ⏳ Planned |
| **POC-06** | *Multi-modal* | **Vision Claim Agent**: Processing visual data (e.g., accident photos) via Claude 3.5. | Java / Vision | ⏳ Planned |
| **POC-07** | *Customization* | **Model Fine-tuning**: Dataset preparation (JSONL) and Bedrock Fine-tuning jobs. | Python / CLI | ⏳ Planned |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Strategy

I use a hybrid approach to simulate a real Enterprise Environment:

* **Application Logic (The "Build"):**
    * **Java 21 / Spring Boot 3:** The standard for production-grade banking/insurance systems.
    * **LangChain4j:** Java-native AI orchestration.
* **Operations & Evaluation (The "Test"):**
    * **Python 3.12 / Boto3 / Ragas:** For rapid scripting, evaluation, and exam-aligned ops.
* **Infrastructure (The "Base"):**
    * **Terraform:** Standardizing IAM, Bedrock access, and Vector Stores.
